# Welcome to ENGL 460

Welcome to Digital Authoring Practices, a new course in the rhetoric and professional writing sequence in the [English Department](https://english.tamu.edu) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu).

In this class, we will be exploring the theory and practice of digital writing. You will be reading texts that ask you to think about how computers (and other digital technologies) change the nature of writing and, in turn, how these changes challenge you to write differently in terms of audience, style, and even content. In addition to the reading, you will be completing a series of experiments designed to orient you within the digital writing scene. Finally, you will work in a team to complete a digital text to experiment with the digital technologies and theories of digitality we have been discussing in class!
