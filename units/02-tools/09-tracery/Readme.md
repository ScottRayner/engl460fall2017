## Journal Prompt

### Part I: Reflect

Now that we have studied several different digital technologies, which do you prefer and why? Do you find that this preference is due to having a specific final project in mind? Or because you think in a particular way?

### Part II: Apply

What kind of argument do you want to make with your final project? What kinds of technologies will you use to do this? What kind of technologies will you have to investigate, that we have not covered, that you might need? Consider this a first draft of your project proposal. This journal entry may be particularly useful for finding a group for your final project, as well.
