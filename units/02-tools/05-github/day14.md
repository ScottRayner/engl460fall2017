# Day 14 – GitHub & Version Control

## Questions As You Prepare For Class
	
## Today's Outline

I want to talk about GitHub, today, which is a industrial-strength concurrent versioning system that we will be using for the next few weeks. Let's first talk about what GitHub is.

### Concurrent Versioning System

GitHub is a social networking site for hosting Git repositories. GitHub is a *concurrent versioning repository*.

**What does that mean?**

1. *concurrent*—Multiple users can work on the same file at once.
1. *versioning*—Git automatically tracks and versions changes to individual files
1. *repository*—With GitHub, files are saved in a central, online location

### What is it For?

Git allows you to store a central or "master" version of your (or your team's) work while keeping local "clones" that you can edit on your own time. GitHub hosts these repositories (for free) and gives it all a nice visual, online interface.

* Share code
* Fix or report bugs
* Store documentation alongside code
* Manage users working on the same files
* Automate communication among group members
* Generate and host static websites with GitHub pages
