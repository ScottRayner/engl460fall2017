## Questions As You Prepare For Class

* What have you used Google Drive for in the past?
	* Are there things you wish you could do with it?
	
## Today's Outline

### OCR in Google Docs

You can use Google Docs to convert image only PDFs into copyable, editable text. This process is known as **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**.

This can be useful for creating digital editions, course handouts, or other applications where having the text from a PDF might be useful.

#### How To

1. Choose a PDF that does not have OCR already. If it is online, download it to your computer.
	* The [Ian Bogost](https://engl460.slack.com/files/U6SFBKTB5/F6T9AF6SH/ian_bogost_-_procedural_rhetoric.pdf) reading has OCR turned on.
	* The [Lev Manovich](https://engl460.slack.com/files/U6SFBKTB5/F6SFLB3FS/lev_manovich_-_the_database.pdf) reading does not.
1. In [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), click the blue "New" button in the upper left hand corner. Choose "File Upload" from the drop-down menu. Browse in your file chooser to the Manovich PDF you downloaded.
	* Alternately, you can drag the file off of your file chooser (Explorer in Windows; Finder in macOS) onto the body of the Drive page in your browser.
1. When the file is finished uploading, find it in Drive. Right click (or Control click in macOS) on the file. From the menu, choose "Open With" and from that menu, choose "Google Docs."
1. Opening with Google Docs takes a while to complete (and if the file is very large, it may fail).
1. When Google Docs is done working, you will have a Google Doc file containing the text (or, at least, an approximation of the text, depending on how bad your source PDF was).
1. At this point, you have what is called **uncorrected OCR**, because OCR is an unreliable process. Once you have gone through your whole document and corrected things, you have **corrected OCR**.

**Note:** With a [scanner app on your phone](https://www.itworld.com/article/2833356/8-best-scanner-apps-for-ios-and-android.html) (my wife loves [Scanner Pro](https://readdle.com/products/scannerpro)), you can go from a physical document to uncorrected OCR to corrected OCR using your phone and Google Drive (some scanner apps also have better OCR algorithms built-in).

### Google Forms

Google Forms lets you collect data from users and store it in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This can be useful for projects that want to utilize crowd-sourcing.

[Here's Google's tutorial](https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/forms/get-started/).

### Data Visualization with Google Sheets

Google Sheets might be the most powerful app on Drive. It is useful for spreadsheet stuff, of course, but because of it's Application Programming Interface (API), Sheets is often used as a database for online applications.

[**Storyline**](storyline.knightlab.com) is a project that makes interactive, embedded timelines using Google Sheets.

Their website has a tutorial, but if you'd like to try here's a dataset: [Population Growth by Year](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gr0xwj9Go7Hn0MlTeye3orjyDWoXMytQJtw1xYEqtkI/edit?usp=sharing). You'll have to choose a particular country to visualize.

[Here's one I made for China](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/storyline/latest/embed/index.html?dataURL=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1s1hGlfX9p8j1RL6EM6f5mDJKd_34tLWYg6FeXSw6QVo%2Fedit%23gid%3D0&dataYCol=populationgrowth&dataXCol=year&dataDateFormat=%25Y&chartDateFormat=%25Y&chartYLabel=populationgrowth&sliderCardTitleCol=title&sliderCardTextCol=text).

### Twitter Bots with Google Sheets

This is a bit more advanced, but my colleague Zach Whalen has [written instructions for using Google Sheets to make a Twitter Bot](http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/).

We will be looking at some other ways to make bots later in the semester, as well, though this one generates text using [Markov chains](https://twitter.com/quintilian_bot?lang=en) or in the style of [Horse_ebooks](https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks?lang=en), which are less predictive but often more fun.
