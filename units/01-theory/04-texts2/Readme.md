## Journal Prompt

### Part I: Reflect

Are video games art? Are they writing? Why or why not? Use the texts we have been discussing in this unit in your discussion as evidence in your argument.

### Part II: Apply

What is a video game you have encountered that seems to make a particular argument? If you have a favorite game that you think does not make an argument, can you consider it more in depth and analyze its argument?
