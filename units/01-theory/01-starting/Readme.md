## Journal Prompt

### Part I: Reflect

How does Slack compare to the Memex? More generally, how does your experience of computers compare with what Vannevar Bush is talking about? Do you think Bush helps us think about digital writing?

### Part II: Apply

Where else do you see yourself using Slack? Has it or Bush's essay changed the way you think about writing on a computer? What have you learned to do cool on Slack that we haven't talked about yet?
