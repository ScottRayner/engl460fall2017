# Day 01: Syllabus + What is the Digital?

## Today's Outline

1. Let's go over the syllabus
1. What is the Digital?
	* What is analog?
1. Why does this matter to writing?
	* Friedrich Kittler:  
		> "[software] also seems to hide the very act of writing: we do not write anymore"
	* Vilém Flusser:  
		> "Writing, in the sense of placing letters and other marks one after another, appears to have little or no future. Information is now more effectively transmitted by codes other than those of written signs. What was once written can now be conveyed more effectively on tapes, records, films, videotapes, videodisks, or computer disks…"
1. How do we write today? Where do we write?

### For Next Time

* As you read "As We May Think," ask yourself how what Bush is describing relates to contemporary computing. Also, think about how what he is describing does not relate to how we use computers.
* For class: either write a paragraph or draw a picture of what you think a Memex looks like, based on Bush's description of it.
