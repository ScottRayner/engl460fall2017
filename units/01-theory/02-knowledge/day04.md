# Day 04 – Alan C Kay's Dynabook

## Read Before Class

* Alan C. Kay, ["A Personal Computer For Children of All Ages"](https://www.mprove.de/diplom/gui/kay72.html)

## Questions As You Prepare For Class

* What kind of device does Alan Kay imagine a computer can be?
	* Why would this be revolutionary at the time he is writing?
* Do you remember any K-12 classrooms that had computers?
	* How did you use them in class?
	* Did it seem to help you learn?
	
## Today's Outline

### Control

> We do not feel that technology is a necessary constituent for this process any more than is the book. It may, however, provide us with a better "book", one which is active (like the child) rather than passive. It may be something with the attention grabbing powers of TV, **but controllable by the child rather than the networks**. It can be like a piano: (a product of technology, yes), but one which can be a tool, a toy, a medium of expression, a source of unending pleasure and delight...and, as with most gadgets in unenlightened hands, a terrible drudge!! (1)

* How does this relate to Bush from Friday?

### Media

> …we think that a large fraction of its use will involve reflexive communication of the owner with himself through this personal medium, much as paper and notebooks are currently used.
>
> A tool is something that aids manipulation of a medium and man is cliched as the "tool building animal". The computer is also regarded as a tool by many. Clearly, though, the book is much more than a tool, and man is much more than a tool builder...he is an inventor of universes. From the moment he learns to see and to use language, each new universe serves as a medium. (and constraint) of expression in which imagined structures can be embedded, usually with the aid. of tools. What about computers? They are clearly more than a tool also, though in typical McLuhanesque fashion, much of their content has been adopted from previous media, and their own attributes are just beginning to be discovered.

* What does "medium" mean in this context?

### Affordances

> This new medium will not "save the world" from disaster. Just as with the book, it brings a new set of horizons and a new set of problems. The book did, however, allow centuries of human knowledge to be encapsulated and transmitted to everybody; perhaps an active medium can also convey some of the excitement of thought and creation!

* Why is the reminder of horizons and problems important in this context?

### Future Classroom

> Jimmy saw what was wrong. "You need to add speed in the direction of the sun no matter where your ship is."
> 
> "But how do we do that? Cripes!"
> 
> "Let's go and ask Mr. Jacobson!" They picked up their DynaBooks and raced across the grass to their teacher who was helping other members of their group to find out what they wanted to know.
> 
> Mr. Jacobson's eyes twinkled at their impatience to know things.

* *Do you remember any K-12 classrooms that had computers?*
	* How did you use them in class?
	* Did it seem to help you learn?
* What would a classroom predicated on "find out what they wanted to know" look like in practice?

### Dynabook

> The size should be no larger than a notebook; weight less than 4lbs.; the visual display should be able to present at least 4000 printing quality characters with contrast ratios approaching that of a book; dynamic graphics of reasonable quality should be possible; there should be removable local file storage of at least one million characters (about 500 ordinary book pages) traded off against several hours of audio (voice/music) files.
> 
> The active interface should be a language which uses linguistic concepts not far removed from the owner of the device. The owner will be able to maintain and edit his own files of text and programs when and where he chooses. He can use his DynaBook as terminal when at work (or as a connection to the library system when in school). When he is done perusing and has discovered information that he wishes to abstract and take with him, it can rapidly be transferred to his local file storage. The umbilical connection will supply not only information but also extra power for any motors the device might have, allowing high bandwidth transmission of about 300K bits/sec to the file storage, or 1500-page book in 1/2 minute. The batteries will also be automatically recharging during this connection.
