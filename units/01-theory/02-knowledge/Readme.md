## Journal Prompt

### Part I: Reflect

Are all texts multimodal? What if I told you they were. Would you believe me? Why or why not? Given that this syllabus is mostly a block of text written in a style roughly corresponding to a technical document, how would you describe it's multimodality? How would an essay be multimodal? If everything is multimodal, why is "multimodal" a useful concept?

### Part II: Apply

Find a Twitter or Tumblr account you enjoy. Use the five modes to analyze how that user is making arguments about who they are as a person. Include a link to the account in question in your journal entry.
