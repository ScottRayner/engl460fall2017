# Day 09 – Rhetorical Analysis

## Read Before Class

## Today's Outline

### Paradigm vs Syntagm in Manovich

* **paradigm**: The collection of all possible choices a creator could make in assembling an argument.
	* All words in English
	* All the clothes in your closet
	* All the videos on YouTube
	* All the links on a Wikipedia page
* **syntagm**: The specific choices, selected from the paradigm, made by the creator in assembling their argument.
	* The words in this sentence
	* The clothes you are wearing
	* The videos you have watched in this session
	* "Why am I reading about politics in 19th century China?"
* In narrative, the syntagm is heavily present while the paradigm is implicitly present
* In database, this is reversed: the syntagm is virtual while the paradigm is concrete
* How does this change the role of the writer?

### Chance & Choice vs. Intent

* In both Lanham and Manovich, chance (aleatory poetry) and choice (font sizes, literature games, and the database) are what shape the reading experience.
* This is in contrast to narrative, which is the product of authorial intent.
* Can you think of examples of intent or chance/choice in non-fiction writing?

### Rhetorical Situation (Again)

> Let us regard rhetorical situation as a natural context of persons, events, objects, relations, and an exigence which strongly invites utterance; this invited utterance participates naturally in the situation, is in many instances necessary to the completion of situational activity, and by means of its participation with situation obtains its meaning and its rhetorical character.
