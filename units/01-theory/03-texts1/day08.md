# Day 08 – Lev Manovich

## Read Before Class

* Lev Manovich, "The Database" from *The Language of New Media* (on [Slack](https://engl460.slack.com/files))

## Questions As You Prepare For Class

* When Lev Manovich says that film is the form of art in the 20th century, what does he mean?
	* Given that, what would it mean for the database to be the form of the 21st century?
* If this is an essay about databases, why does he talk about film?
	
## Today's Outline

### Database

> After the novel, and subsequently cinema, privileged narrative as the key form of cultural expression of the modern age, the computer age introduces its correlate-the database. Many new media objects do not tell stories they they do not have any development, or otherwise that would organize their elements into a sequence. Instead, they are collections of individual items, with every item possessing the same significance as any other. (218)

* What does Manovich about a key form of cultural expression?
* What would it mean for cultural expression to be a database?

### Collection to Access

> New media objects may or may not employ these highly structured database models; however, from the point of view of the user's experience, a large proportion of them are databases in a more basic sense. They appear as collections of items on which the user can perform various operations-view, navigate, search. The user's experience of such computerized collections is, therefore, quite distinct from reading a narrative or watching a film or navigating an architectural site. Similarly, a literary or cinematic narrative, an architectural plan, and a database each present a different model of what a world is like. It is this sense of database as a cultural form of its own that I want to address here. Following art historian Erwin Panofsky's analysis of linear perspective as a "symbolic form" of the modern age, we may even call database a new symbolic form of the computer age…(219)

> [After the arrival of the computer], the world appears to us as an endless and unstructured collection of images, texts, and other data records, it is only appropriate that we will be moved to model it as a database. But it is also appropriate that we would want to develop a poetics, aesthetics, and ethics of this database. (219)

* What kinds of things can we imagine as being like this?
* Do artistic forms shape our worldview in this way?

### Web

> As defined by original HTML, a Web page is a sequential list of separate elements-text blocks, images, digital video clips, and links to other pages. It is always possible to add a new element to the list-all you have to do is to open a file and add a new line. As a result, most Web pages are collections of separate elements-texts, images, links to other pages, or sites. Á homepage is a collection of personal photographs. A site of a major search engine is a collection of numerous links to other sites (along with a search function, of course). A site of a Web-based TV or radio station offers a collection of video or audioprograms along with the option to listen to the current broadcast, but this current program is just one choice among many other programs stored on the site. Thus the traditional broadcasting experience, which consists solely of a real-time transmission, becomes just one element in a collection of options. (220)

* If the web is a collection of elements, do we read it as such?

### Games

> Of course, not all new media objects are explicitly databases. Computer games, for instance, are experienced by their players as narratives. In a game, he player is given a well-defined task-winning the match, being first in a race, reaching the last level, or attaining the highest score. It is this task that makes the player experience the game as a narrative. Everything that happens to her in a game, all the characters and objects she encounters, either take her closer to achieving the goal or further away from it. Thus, in contrast to a CD-ROM and Web database, which always appear arbitrary because the user knows additional material could have been added without modifying the logic, in a game, from the user's point of view, all the elements are motivated (i.e., their presence is justified). (222)

* Does this description still hold up? Are games just collections of levels?
* This section argues that games have an algorithm: what's an algorithm?

### Narrative

> As a cultural form, the database represents the world as a list of items, and it refuses to order this list. In contrast, a narrative creates a cause-and-effect trajectory of seemingly unordered items events. Therefore, database and narrative are natural enemies. Competing for the same territory of human culture, each claims an exclusive right to make meaning out of the world. (225)

> This formulation places the opposition between database and narrative in a new light, thus redefining our concept of narrative. The "user" of a narrative is traversing a database, following links between its records as established by the database's creator. An interactive narrative (which can be also called a hypernarrative in an analogy with hypertext) can then be understood as the sum of multiple trajectories through a database. A traditional linear narrative is one among many other possible trajectories, that is, a particular choice made within a hypernarrative. Just as a traditional cultural object can now be seen as a particular case of a new media object (i.e., a new media object that has only one interface), traditional linear narrative can be seen as a particular case of hypernarrative. (227)

> [About *Man With a Movie Camera*] Therefore, in contrast to standard film editing that consists of selection and ordering of previously shot material according to a preexistent script, here the process of relating shots to each other, ordering, and reordering them to discover the hidden order of the world constitutes the film's method. (240)

* Do you agree that narratives were always just databases?
	* Why does Manovich do this?
	
### New Media Narrative

> Although the database form may be, inherent to new media, Countless attempts to create "interactive narratives" testify to our dissatisfaction with the computer in the sole role of encyclopedia or catalog of effects. We want new media narratives, and we want these narratives to be different from the narratives we have seen or read before. In fact, regardless of how often we repeat in public that the modernist notion of medium specificity ("every medium should develop its own unique language") is obsolete, we do expect Computer narratives to showcase new aesthetic possibilities that did not exist before digital computers. In short, we want them to be new media specific. Given the dominance of the database in computer software and the key role it plays in the computer-based design process, perhaps we can arrive at new kinds of narrative by focusing our attention on how narrative and database can work together. How can a narrative take into account the fact that its elements are organized in a database? *How can our new abilities to store vast amounts of data, to automatically classify, index, link, search, and instantly retrieve it, lead to new kinds of narratives?*
