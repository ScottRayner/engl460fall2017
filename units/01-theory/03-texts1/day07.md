## Today's Outline

### Democracy + The Past?

> Electronic media will change not only the future texts but past ones as well. (269)

> Electronic "textbooks" are democratizing education in all the arts in the same way that the invention of printing reinforced the spread of Protestantism. (272)

* This essay was written in 1989, does Lanham's description of the future sounds like our present?

### Decorum

**decorum, n.**

**1.** That which is proper, suitable, seemly, befitting, becoming; fitness, propriety, congruity.

> The classical notion of decorum, like modern equivalents—"clarity," "authenticity," and so on—measures an effect on the beholder. If a style works, if it creates the transparent illusion, it is decorous. Decorum is such a poor descriptive term precisely because it describes so many different kinds of verbal patterns yet allows only one virtue, unselfconscious transparency. (276)

> Pixeled print calls this basic stylistic decorum, and the social ideal built upon it, into question. Electronic typography is both creator-controlled and reader-controlled. The screen upon which these words appear as I write has five sizes of a dozen Roman type styles and two Greek styles at its immediate command and literally hundreds more in second-level storage. I can enlarge the print if my eyes get tired, reduce it to check format and page layout, flow it around illustration if I want. I can redesign the very shapes of the letters, zoom in on them until their transparency becomes an abstract pattern of separate pixels.I can alter the whole alphabetic/graphic ratio of conventional literacy in dozens of ways. I can reverse the basic black/white, figure/ground relationship. I can create and maintain a purely transparent verbal surface, **but I need not**. (266-267)

> The textual surface is now a malleable and self-conscious one. All kinds of production decisions have now become authorial ones. The textual surface has become permanently bistable. We are always looking first AT it and then THROUGH it, and this oscillation creates a different implied ideal of decorum, both stylistic and behavioral. (267)

* Does this discussion of bistable decorum relate to our discussion of multimodality on Friday? If so, how? If not, why not?

### Control

> I can reformat a text to make it easier to read, or, using a dozen transformations, make it harder, or just different, to read. I can literally color my colors of rhetoric. I can heal the long hiatus of silent reading and make the text read itself aloud. At present this reading sounds a little funky, but it will become an expressive parameter as agile and wide as the others. I can embolden my own special key words and places. I can reformat prose into poetry. I can illuminate my manuscript in ways that would make a medieval scribe weep with envy. (267)

* Does control over the display of a text lead to a more democratic medium?

### *Paradise Lost*

> How would feel about *Paradise Lost* when presented to you in a codex book? Probably you'd prefer to access it from the CD-ROM disk which, in a few years, will contain all the texts you were asked to read—or ever could read—in your undergraduate career. Wouldn't you begin to play games with it? A weapon in your hands after 2500 years of pompous pedantry about the Great Books, and you not to use it? (269)

> And as literary scholars above all should know, where the verbal creative spirit has room to play, play it will. (267)

* Would you play games with *Paradise Lost*?

### Aleatory Poetry

> And because all arts face the same technological pressures, they are going to find, create, new relationships through that technology, through their new digital equivalences. Such equivalences pose the most fundamental, and most obvious, challenges to the structure and purpose of the university arts curriculum, and to the place of literary study in it. The shocked responses to chance techniques of creation in experimental music will no doubt be duplicated in responses to programs which create **aleatory poetry**. (275)

**aleatory, adj.**

depending on the throw of a dice or on chance; random.
