# Descriptive Grading Criteria

At the end of the semester, you will write a [linked letter](./assignments#linked-letter), produce a short video, or meet with me in person to discuss your progress through the semester. With this document or in this meeting, you will be arguing for the grade you think you deserve based on your work in class. To help you make that argument, you *must* use language from this chart along with concrete evidence to justify the grade you are arguing.
