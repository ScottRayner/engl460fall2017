## Grading

There is a growing body of scientific evidence ([click here for a summary and an explanation of what we will be doing in class](http://observer.com/2017/04/teachers-going-gradeless-education-reform-grades/)) that providing scores either along with or in place of commentary on student work, especially written work, does not produce the educational objectives schooling is meant to provide. Students are either discouraged by a bad score or made complacent by a good score. Numerical or letter grades are a distraction from learning.

In this class especially, I want you to leave this semester with a better understanding of these technologies, how to use them, and why they matter to our changing world. As such, I will be providing extensive written feedback on everything you write for this class, both in terms of content and form, but I will not be placing an arbitrary number or letter on anything you write.

If you would like to know how you are doing, please consult the [Descriptive Grading Criteria](./descriptive-grading-criteria.md) which provide language for mapping our learning objectives and your work to a letter grade. Though you will be required at the end of the semester to provide an argumentative justification, I will be more than happy to chat over [Slack](https://engl460.slack.com), email, or in person in office hours about how I see you doing and what you might need to be doing to improve. I will also be writing my feedback on your assignments based on the idea of helping you improve as a writer in both analog and digital forms.

### Getting Your Grade

Having said that, I am still required by the University to assign you a grade at the end of the semester. However, I want this grade to reflect how you and I think you have grown as a writer during the semester. As such, at the end of the semester, you will make an argument supported by evidence for how you think you did as a student in this class.

I have supplied a list of [Descriptive Grading Criteria](./descriptive-grading-criteria.md) that will help you effectively argue for the grade you feel you have earned. Read over this list as you reflect on the work you produced and the learning you did to guide yourself toward an honest assessment of the work you did during the semester. The content of your argument will be drawn from the criteria and you must make use of its language in your argument. Once you have decided on the grade, you will need to document your argument in one of three ways:

#### In-Person Conference

Schedule a time to meet with me during finals week and we can spend 15 minutes or so going over the work you have done in which I will listen to and offer contributions to your argument for what grade you feel you deserve. At the end, we will arrive together on your final grade.

If that sounds terrifying, you also have two options for documenting your grade without meeting in person (though I won't be able to help you along through your argument).

#### Linked Letter

Write me a [business letter](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/653/01/) laying out your argument. Link to the work you have done over the semester using hyperlinks, screenshots, or block quotes to show me *specific* evidence of how you have grown as a writer.

#### Video

You may also produce a video outlining the same argument. You will want to include visual evidence (using PowerPoint or screencasting tools) to make your argument. Pay special attention to the five modes in your video.

## Journal

During class, you will keep a weekly journal in which you reflect on course discussion and apply what you have learned.

Journals are due on Wednesdays and you post them to our [Slack](https://engl460.slack.com).

Each week's Readme.md file contains a journal prompt that asks you to reflect and apply the lessons discussed in class during the week. Your response to the prompt should be shared with me on Slack by the following Wednesday.

### Learning Outcomes

This assignment is meant to teach you how to:

* Document your understanding of course goals by concreate reflection.
* Identify key concepts from our reading & course discussion.
* Apply these key concepts to real world examples of digital authoring.

### How To Journal on Slack

1. Find the "Direct Messages" section of the sidebar on Slack. It will list all the users in our course. One link will be to your username (it will also have " (you)" after the name to make sure you know that it is your account). Click on your name.
1. You are now [direct message with yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG1NrQYXjLU). Click the "+" next to the post box (where it says "Jot something down"). This will open a new post window.
1. Title the post with your name and the week of the class (1, 2, 3). So, for instance, my title for week 3 would be "Andrew Pilsch Week 3 Journal".
1. You can write your journal entry in the editor. Once we learn [Markdown](../units/02-tools/06-markdown), you can use Markdown in the editor. The post will automatically save.
	* If you close the editor without finishing your post, you can get back to it by visiting [https://engl460.slack.com/files](https://engl460.slack.com/files) and click on "My Files" to see the list of posts.
1. At this point, the post will be private. Hit the green "Share" button in the upper right of the post editor. In the "Share with" dropdown, either select me "apilsch" or type "apilsch" to find me. Click "Share" to let me know you are done with your journal. I cannot give you credit for your journal entries until you share them with me.
1. **(optional)** You may also share your journal entries to the `03-journals` channel to invite your classmates to read and comment on your posts.

## Final Project

For the final project, you will work in groups to produce a digital artifact that uses the theories of digital text we discussed in the [theory section](../units/01-theory) and/or the technologies we discused in the [tools section](../units/02-tools) (as well as others you identify with your group and with my help). Your artifact must respond to a particular rhetorical situation and *make an argument* in some way (this argument can be about the nature of digital texts or it can be about anything else).

The final project will be evaluated less on how polished your final artifact is and more on how thoroughly your group completes the scaffolding components and, most importantly, *how well your final artifact makes the argument you planned to make*.

As to the specific genre or modes you use, this decision will be up to your group, though in learning [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Twine](https://twinery.org/), and [Tracery](http://tracery.io/), we have learned about three tools that could be used to create projects. You may also make a video or investigate another genre or problem space in which you would like to intervene.

### Learning Outcomes

This assignment is meant to teach you how to:

* Formulate an argument that can be made using a digital text.
* Work as a team to produce a persuasive digital text.
* Plan and organize a team-driven project.
* Use project management software to track and organize progress.
* Design a digital text as a mockup and produce a final text from mockups.

### Components

There are four required and one optional component to the final project. Three of the required components and the optional component are to be completed and turned in as a group. The final component, [the Group Work Report](#group-work-report), will be turned in individually.

#### Proposal

The first step for creating your final project artifact will be to propose your project. A proposal is a formal statement of intent that is a standard way of inaugurating and outlining a new project, though it is increasingly being replaced in business with the less formal pitch presentation.

Your group's proposal will have the following elements:

* **Overview**: What are you making? How will you make it? What will be the genre of the artifact? What argument is your artifact making?
* **Plan**: What is the *detailed* plan for creating this artifact in support of your argument? Which technologies will you use? How will you share/create/access different assets you will need? What are the specific and detailed tasks you will need to complete to build your artifact?
* **Justification**: Why is your proposed design the most effective way of making this argument?
* **Collaboration Plan**: Who in your group will be responsible for each task?
* **Timeline**: When will each element of the artifact identified in the **Plan** be completed?
	* Make sure to include the [**Mockup**](#mockup) and the [**Group Work Report**](#group-work-report) in your timeline.

This proposal can take any form you want, though I will need an artifact. If you are most comfortable writing stuff, you can create a standard technical report. If you would prefer to try your hand at a pitch presentation, you can pitch it in class or to me in my office hours, or submit it as a narrated PowerPoint presentation (though we would need to chat on [Slack](https://engl460.slack.com) afterwards).

#### Group Contract (optional)

If you would like to set standards of accountability for your group members, please draw up a contract that will outline specific consequences for what happens if deadlines are not met, meetings are missed, or items in the plan are not completed. Draft this contract as you see fit and include it in the **Proposal** and I will provide feedback and suggest revisions before the contract becomes binding.

If you choose to complete a group contract, we (your group and I) will be bound by its contents.

#### Mockup

After your proposal has been approved by me (and been evaluated by your peers, if you like), your group can start building a mockup. This can be at any level of sophistication you want and must conform to what you are proposing to build.

For instance, if you are making something using [Twine](https://twinery.org), your mockup could be a collection of note cards that map out the space of your story. If you are making a website, you might create a [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) or a series of rough drawings to outline how the site will work. If you are creating a video, you might create a [storyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard). How you do this is up to you, but the mockup needs to give some sense of how the finished product will work.

#### Artifact

This is the central focus of the project. You will need to create the artifact you described in your proposal and have demoed via your mock-up.

Plan to do a demonstration of your project during the final two weeks of class. In this presentation, you outline your argument, show us your project, discuss the process of creating the artifact, reflect on how you would do the project differently, and 

#### Group Work Report

How did everything go? Write me a roughly one page reflection on:

1. How you worked as a collaborator
1. How your team members worked as collaborators
1. What you did that worked
1. What you did that did not work

This document will be individually authored by each team member and will help me evaluate everyone's projects for the final course grade.
